#+title: Orgmode to HTML
#+author: Santiago Pedroza

This is a little org-mode parser made in Javascript.
* Why?
Because I was bored in my classes and started making an idea that came to my mind. 

* TODOS

- [ ] Add Latex support with Mathjax
- [ ] Add support for tables
- [ ] Add support for hyperlinks
- [ ] Add support for TODO and DONE items.
* DREAMS
- [ ] Add support for recursive generation.

* FIX
- [ ] Multiple lines instead of a single long line when writing a paragraph.
- [X] The numbered lists go insane.
- [ ] Parse the lines correctly from beginning to end so you can actually use /italics/, *bold*, _underline_, +crossed+, ~this~, =code=, [[hyperlinks][https://news.ycombinator.com/]],
